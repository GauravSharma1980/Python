                    But we dont know how to use it
                    - IMMUTABLE
                    
2. Strings: We already have option to store collection of characters like name, email-id etc
                    But we dont know how to use it
                    - IMMUTABLE
                    - Automatically index number will be assigned to each character we store

3. list:  We already have option to store collection of elements like list 0f names, list of email-ids etc
                    But we dont know how to use it
                    - MUTABLE: After creating the list, throught the program we can alter/modify
                        (we can add element / we can remove element / we can update element)
                    - Automatically index number will be assigned to each value we store

4. Tuple:  We already have option to store collection of elements like list 0f names, list of email-ids etc
                    But we dont know how to use it
                    -IMMUTABLE: After creating the list, throught the program we CAN'T alter/modify
                        (we CAN'T add element / we CAN'T remove element / we CAN'T update element)
                    - Automatically index number will be assigned to each value we store

5. Dictionary:  We already have option to store collection of elements like list 0f names, list of email-ids etc
                    But we dont know how to use it
                    - MUTABLE: After creating the dictionary, throught the program we can alter/modify
                        (we can add element / we can remove element / we can update element)
                    - We can provide our own index. We also call this as KEY:VALUE pair
                

6. Set:  We already have option to store collection of elements like list 0f names, list of email-ids etc
                    But we dont know how to use it
                    - MUTABLE: After creating the set, throught the program we can alter/modify
                        (we can add element / we can remove element / we can update element)
                    - Keeps only UNIQUE values
